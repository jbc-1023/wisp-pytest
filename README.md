# Tic-Tac-Toe API

This is a Tic-Tac-Toe API built using Flask for the backend and SQLite for the database.
The API allows users to register, log in, create a new game, update the game's move data, and declare a winner.

## Features

- User Registration and Authentication
- Create Games
- Stores the moves in the game
- Declare a winner
- Track wins per user

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Flask
- **Database:** SQLite
- **Testing tool:** pytest

This project uses [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#module-venv)

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- SQLite

### Setup steps

1. Clone the repository:

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    . .venv/bin/activate
    ```
3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. Spin up a SQLite DB based on the preconfigured schema:
    ```bash
    python -m flask init-db
    ```


## Running the Application

1. Start the Flask server:
    ```bash
    python -m flask run
    ```

## Running the test suite

1. Run the pytest test suite using this command:
    ```bash
    python -m pytest
    ```
    Note: if you have trouble with this command, make sure you've activated venv

## Takehome prompt
Currently, the API has no backend tests and your task is to write tests in Pytest for code coverage.
Files have been added to the `./tests/` directory where you can write tests. Here are the requirements:
- We are asking you to write both unit tests and integration/functional/API tests. Show us that you can do both!
- You must use Pytest. We use that framework here at Wisp.
- You may make updates to the `conftest.py` file, write your own test helpers, or add additional dependencies (e.g., Factory Boy).
- In general, try to avoid refactoring any of the API code except in cases where it makes testing the code easier.
- Limit yourself to 2 hours of work. That means you should prioritize key features that should have test coverage! Don't worry too much
  about getting to 100% coverage. We care more about the quality of your work than your quantity.

### Project Submission
Please submit your test code as a Pull Request.

- Within the PR, please include:
  - Any decisions you made and your reasoning. Examples:
      - Refactored the "Make Move" endpoint because...
      - Added a new dependency because...
  - Any test cases you couldn't get to, but would like to in the future.

Once you open your PR, reach back out to the hiring manager for review.

### Evaluation

Weâ€™ll review your code submission for the following:

- Functionality: Do the tests cover relevant functional areas, are they are flaky, and are they performant.
- Test find-ability, organization and maintainability.
- General coding practices including naming, code structure, and readability.
